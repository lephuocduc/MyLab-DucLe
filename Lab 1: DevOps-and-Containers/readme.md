An introduction to the principles of DevOps and containerisation using Azure DevOps and Azure Kubernetes Service. This lab borrows heavily from the excellent [Azure DevOps Hands on Labs website](https://www.azuredevopslabs.com/labs/vstsextend/kubernetes/), but adds in a bit more detail on some steps for users new to Cloud or Azure.
