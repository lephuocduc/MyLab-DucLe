# Get Ready for DevOps and Containers

An introduction to the principles of DevOps and containerisation using Azure DevOps and Azure Kubernetes Service. This lab borrows heavily from the excellent [Azure DevOps Hands on Labs website](https://www.azuredevopslabs.com/labs/vstsextend/kubernetes/), but adds in a bit more detail on some steps for users new to Cloud or Azure.

## What is Kubernetes and the Azure Kubernetes Service?

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration system that automates deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It is a popular choice for running containerized applications in production, as it provides a number of features that make it easy to manage and scale applications. To understand a bit more about Kubernetes, we really recommend [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ht22ReBjno) - it's an illustrated guide to Kubernetes and does an amazing job of distilling some advanced concepts into a short video guide.
